// state which can be a combination of `LoadingState<T>` and `Result<Success, Failure>`.
// See `AccountPickerView.swift` and associated state for sample usage.

/// `LoadingState<Value>` stateful view
///
/// States handled:
/// `.loaded(Value)`
/// `.loading`

/// See example usage in `AccountPickerView.swift`

/// - Parameters:
///   - store: Store scoped to your `LoadingState<Value>` state.
///   - loadedAction: Pullback converting Loaded action to store action
///   - loadingAction: Pullback converting Loading action to store action
///   - loaded: View displayed when state is loaded
///   - loading: View displayed when state is loading
/// - Returns: A SwiftUI view
